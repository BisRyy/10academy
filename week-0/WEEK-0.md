The challenge aims to evaluate candidates for the 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE).</p><p>Applicants who proceed to the next level by demonstrating sufficient performance in this week's challenge will gain a clear understanding of the discipline, resilience, proactivity, and talent diversity required for the 10 Academy training. Those who do not make it to the limited spots available will gain insight into areas for improvement to prepare for FA, DE, &amp; MLE job positions in the future. Everyone will gain project experience to showcase in their professional profile.</p><p>This week is a win-win for everyone. We advise you to put your best effort into completing as many tasks as possible. The number of tasks may seem overwhelming, and you may not have time to build intuition or become comfortable with the new concepts and skills you're exposed to. Please note that building a deeper understanding is not the purpose of this week's project. Moreover, you may have never done or attempted some of the tasks before this training. If you feel confused or overwhelmed, know that it is expected.</p><p>The tutors, community managers, and all other teams are here to support you as best as they can. Be proactive in asking questions, provide resources that may help others, and above all, persist!</p><h3>Business Objective</h3><p>MoonLight Energy Solutions aims to develop a strategic approach to significantly enhance its operational efficiency and sustainability through targeted solar investments. As an Analytics Engineer at MoonLight Energy Solutions, your task is to perform a quick analysis of an environmental measurement provided by the engineering team and translate your observations into a strategy report. Your analysis should focus on identifying key trends and gaining valuable insights that will support your data-driven case—your recommendation based on statistical analysis and EDA.</p><p>In particular, your analysis and recommendation must present a strategy focusing on identifying high-potential regions for solar installation that align with the company's long-term sustainability goals. Your report should provide insights to help realize the overarching objectives of MoonLight Energy Solutions.</p><h3>Dataset Overview</h3><p><strong>Solar Radiation Measurement Data</strong><br>The data for this week's challenge is extracted and aggregated from Solar Radiation Measurement Data. Each row in the data contains values for solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation, wind speed, wind direction, cleaned and soiled radiance sensors (soiling measurement), and cleaning events.</p><h4>The structure of the data is as follows:</h4><ul><li><strong>Timestamp (yyyy-mm-dd hh):</strong> Date and time of each observation.</li><li><strong>GHI (W/m²):</strong> Global Horizontal Irradiance, the total solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface.</li><li><strong>DNI (W/m²):</strong> Direct Normal Irradiance, the amount of solar radiation received per square meter on a surface perpendicular to the rays of the sun.</li><li><strong>DHI (W/m²):</strong> Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance, solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface that does not arrive on a direct path from the sun.</li><li><strong>ModA (W/m²):</strong> Measurements from a module or sensor (A), similar to irradiance.</li><li><strong>ModB (W/m²):</strong> Measurements from a module or sensor (B), similar to irradiance.</li><li><strong>Tamb (°C):</strong> Ambient Temperature in degrees Celsius.</li><li><strong>RH (%):</strong> Relative Humidity as a percentage of moisture in the air.</li><li><strong>WS (m/s):</strong> Wind Speed in meters per second.</li><li><strong>WSgust (m/s):</strong> Maximum Wind Gust Speed in meters per second.</li><li><strong>WSstdev (m/s):</strong> Standard Deviation of Wind Speed, indicating variability.</li><li><strong>WD (°N (to east)):</strong> Wind Direction in degrees from north.</li><li><strong>WDstdev:</strong> Standard Deviation of Wind Direction, showing directional variability.</li><li><strong>BP (hPa):</strong> Barometric Pressure in hectopascals.</li><li><strong>Cleaning (1 or 0):</strong> Signifying whether cleaning (possibly of the modules or sensors) occurred.</li><li><strong>Precipitation (mm/min):</strong> Precipitation rate measured in millimeters per minute.</li><li><strong>TModA (°C):</strong> Temperature of Module A in degrees Celsius.</li><li><strong>TModB (°C):</strong> Temperature of Module B in degrees Celsius.</li><li><strong>Comments:</strong> This column is designed for any additional notes.</li></ul><h3>Week's Topics Covered</h3><ul><li><strong>Python Programming:</strong> Task-specific programming assignments.</li><li><strong>GitHub Commands:</strong> Continuous committing and repository management.</li><li><strong>Data Understanding and Exploration:</strong> Applying exploratory data analysis techniques.</li><li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> Understanding continuous integration and continuous deployment.</li><li><strong>Streamlit:</strong> Creating a dashboard using Streamlit.</li></ul><h3>Deliverables and Tasks to be done</h3><h4>Task 1: Git and GitHub</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p><ul><li>Setting up Python environment</li><li>Git version control</li><li>CI/CD</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):</strong></p><ul><li>Dev Environment Setup.</li><li>Relevant skill in the area demonstrated.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Suggested folder structure:</strong></p><pre><div class="dark bg-gray-950 rounded-md border-[0.5px] border-token-border-medium"><div class="flex items-center relative text-token-text-secondary bg-token-main-surface-secondary px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-markdown">├── .vscode/
